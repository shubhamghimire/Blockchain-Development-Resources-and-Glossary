Term,Definition
51% Attack,When more than 50% of the miners in a blockchain launch an attack on the rest of the nodes/users to attempt to steal assets or double spend.
Address,"Much like a URL, a blockchain address is the location to or from which transactions occur on the blockchain."
Alt-coin,Any coin or token other than Bitcoin.
Attestation Ledger,"A register or account book created for the purpose of providing support/evidence of individual transactions. Normally, an attestation ledger is used to verify that a transaction has been carried out, or to verify the authenticity of products or transactions."

Block,A group of transactions entered into a blockchain; analogous to a page of a ledger or record book.
Blockchain,"A mathematical structure for storing digital transactions or data in an immutable, distributed, decentralized digital ledger consisting of blocks that are linked via cryptographic signature that is nearly impossible to fake, hack or disrupt."
Blockchain (Private a.k.a. Permissioned),A blockchain that resides on a private network of computers that is only accessible to those with permission.
Blockchain (Public a.ka. Permissionless),A blockchain that resides on a network of computers around the world that is accessible to everyone.
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT),"A property of a distributed, decentralized system to resist complete failure even when some of the nodes fail or act maliciously."
Centralized,"A system or process for which there is a singular (i.e., central) source of authority, control and/or truth."
Chain of Custody,The entire chain of documentation of ownership of a product during its lifecycle from raw materials to the final end user.
Chaincode,Another name for a smart contract.
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Authority (PoA),"PoA is an alternative form to the PoS algorithm. Instead of staking cryptocurrency (wealth), in PoA you stake your identity. This means voluntarily disclosing who you are in exchange for the right to validate blocks. Any malicious actions you undertake as a validator will reflect back on your identity. PoA blockchains require a thorough form of KYC (Know Your Customer - a verification process that determines you actually are who you claim to be)."
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Burn (PoB),"PoB allows the miners to “burn” or destroy cryptocurrency which grants them the right to add blocks in proportion to the coins destroyed. Essentially, miners burn coins/tokens to buy virtual mining rigs that give them the power to mine blocks. The more currency burned by the miner, the bigger the ensuing virtual mining rig. To burn, miners send currency to a verifiably un-spendable address. This process does not consume many resources, thus PoB is often called PoW without energy waste. Depending upon the implementation, miners are allowed to burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, and in exchange, they receive a reward in the native currency of the blockchain."
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Capacity (PoC),"PoC allows the mining devices in the network to use their available hard drive space to decide the mining rights, instead of using the mining device’s computing power (as in PoW) or the miner’s stake in the cryptocurrency (as in PoS)."
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Stake (PoS),"In PoS, miners put up(i.e., ""stake"") some of the blockchain's cryptocurrency (e.g., ether for the Ethereum blockchain) in order to increase their chances of being selected to validate a block. The stake is locked up as a deposit to ensure the miner validates the block according to the rules. If the miner violates the rules, the deposit will be ""burned"" or destroyed. PoS is less resource intensive than PoW since fewer miners are racing to solve the mathematical formula."
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Work (PoW),"In PoW, transaction data (block) + a random strings of digits (nonce of block) are repeatedly applied to a (hashing) mathematical formula by miners, until a desirable outcome is found (the proof of work). Other miners then verify the proof of work by taking the alleged input string and applying it to the same formulae to see if the outcome is indeed that what was presented. If the results are the same, the transaction is verified and added to the blockchain. As many miners are racing to solve the formula which requires a great deal of computing power, PoW is resource intensive."
Consensus Mechanism (a.k.a. Consensus Protocol),The process used to validate a transaction across a distributed blockchain network designed to achieve Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
Cryptocurrency,"Digital money which uses encryption and consensus algorithms to regulate the generation of coins/tokens and transfer of funds. Cryptocurrencies are generally decentralized, operating independently of central authorities."
Cryptography,The science of securing communication using individualized codes so only the participating parties can read the messages.
DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization),"A governance structure without a central authority which rewards good behavior and penalizes bad behavior by a set of pre-defined rules which can only be changes by a vote, which typically requires a stake, adding risk to the process to discourage bad actors, amongst the participants."
DApp,"Software which does not rely on a central system or database but can share information amongst its users via a decentralized database, such as a blockchain"
Decentralization/Decentralized,A system with no single point where the decision is made. Every node makes a decision for its own behavior and the resulting system behavior is the aggregate response.
Digital Identity (a.k.a. Self-Sovereign Identity),"The network or Internet equivalent to the real identity of a person or entity (like a business or government agency). Advocates of blockchain-based digital identity is to return ownership and control of personal information to the individuals. In any given transaction, personal information is not disclosed, but rather the information required by one party is verified by the digital identity application."
Digital Signature,A mathematical scheme for verifying digital messages or documents satisfy two requirements - they have authenticity (from a known sender) and integrity (were not altered in transit.
Digital Signature - Multi-signature,"In order to increase security, mutisig addresses require more than one digital signature (and therefore multiple keys) to sign a transaction or message."
Digital Signature - Ring,A digital signature that can be performed by any of a group of people that each have keys. A property of a ring signature is that it is impossible to determine which of the group signed the transaction.
Distributed,"As opposed to decentralized, a distributed system shares processing and/or data across multiple nodes, but the decisions may still be centralized and use complete system knowledge."
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT),The larger class of technology of which blockchain is a subset. A digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple identical copies at the same time with no central data store or administration.
